The Strap{4} and the Center Section of the headband{1} must both be printed in 95a tpu. Its easier to print with than you think.  
The only part aside from the comfort strap that requires special settings is the Rear Ring{A} and its very similar instructions to the comfort strap.  
Using the per model settings select the center circle of the Rear Housing and change the wall line count, top layers, and bottom layers to 0.  
Change the infill line width to .6 and the infill pattern and density to the settings listed below.

Tested infill patterns are as follows:

- Cubic Subdivision at 50% Infill Density
- Lines at 40% Infill Density
- Gyroid at 30% Infill Density
